The weather app allows the user to access the current weather and a 5 day forecast of the chosen city. The user has to put the name in the input box and proceed to press search.

Every time the user inputs a new city, the information on the dashboard changes accordingly. Also, a list is created with the cities the user adds.

If the user wants to revisit the information of a city he already added to the list, the data will update after clicking on the name of the city.

The data displayed consists on dates, an image that represent the weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index (5 day forecast doesn't include wind speed nor UV index). UV index turns into a color depending the value for each city (See attached image for color reference)
